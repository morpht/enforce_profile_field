# Enforce Profile Field

## Overview

The Enforce Profile Field module implements a field which can be used to make sure users have filled in certain fields in their profile. If the user has not completed the fields, they will be redirected to a User Display tab on their profile where they can enter the information. When the form is submitted, they are returned to the original page.

This module is helpful in cases where you have optional user profile fields and you want to enforce that certain fields need to be completed in order for a user to gain access to content. Users can quickly register with a minimal amount of information and can then be required to divulge more as they need to access new parts of the site.

The module is based around "Form Displays" for a user and can be used in conjunction with the [Form Mode Manager](https://www.drupal.org/project/form_mode_manager) module which can provide different tabs for the user profile.
